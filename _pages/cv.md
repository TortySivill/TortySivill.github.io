Education
======
* Ph.D in Explainable AI, University of Bristol, 2024 
  * Independently developed novel algorithms which explain the outcomes of complex machine learning models
  * Extensive knowledge of machine learning algorithms (Classification and Regression algorithms) including
deep learning paradigms (back propagation, gradient descent, LSTMs, CNNs, RNNs)
  * Experienced applying and adapting open-source machine learning algorithms to new datasets through Python
packages including Keras, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn
  * Extensive knowledge of gaussian processes and representation learning from project applying hierarchical
processes to time series
  * Extensive knowledge of game theory (the Shapley value and coalitional games), causal inference (Pearl’s do
calculus), probabilistic programming paradigms
  * (Developed open source explainability software tools which accompany research articles and have been forked
multiple times
 * Led project using transactional data to measure period poverty in England. Applied machine learning pipeline
to large data set (over 200 million transactions). Experience in SQL
* MEng in Computer Science, University of Bristol, 2018
  * Units studied include: “Machine Learning”, “Artificial Intelligence”, “Web Technologies”,
