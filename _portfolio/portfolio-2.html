The amount of health related longitduinal data available is constantly increasing, exacerbated by the ubuiquity of wearable devices like fitbits. So why isn't longitudinal data more widely used in predictive AI systems?

The problem lies in the complexity of this kind of data: time series data recorded from a human is often noisy and misrepresented, thus true meaning is likely to be obsured and confounded when building predictive systems. Further challenges inherent to longituidnal data include stationarity, seasonality and auto-correlation.

It therefore remains an open problem in machine learning how to best extract the underlying knowledge represented by a time series.
